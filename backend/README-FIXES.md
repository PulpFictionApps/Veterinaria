Fixes and rollout instructions

This file lists the safe steps to fix the production issue with Pet.updatedAt and how to enable booking-by-slotId.

1) Back up your production DB
   - Always take a full logical backup (pg_dump) or snapshot before applying schema/data changes.

2) Dry-run backfill (safe)
   - From repo root:
     cd backend; npm run backfill-pet-updatedAt:dry
   - This will print pets that would be updated. No writes performed.

3) Apply backfill (after backup)
   - cd backend; npm run backfill-pet-updatedAt:apply
   - Verifies and updates null updatedAt values.

4) Apply SQL to set DEFAULT for updatedAt (optional but recommended)
   - Review `backend/scripts/fix-pet-updatedAt.sql`.
   - After backup, run the SQL against your DB (psql -f fix-pet-updatedAt.sql) or via your migration tooling.
   - This will backfill any remaining NULLs and set a DEFAULT now() for new rows.

5) Booking-by-slotId
   - Backend endpoints have been updated to accept `slotId` (availability.id) for protected and public bookings and for PATCH reschedules.
   - Frontend public booking form now sends `slotId` when selecting an available slot.
   - Recommended: update any other client that used to POST raw ISO dates to send `slotId` instead.

6) DB-clean script
   - A `scripts/clean-db.js` script exists to normalize availability ranges into 1-hour slots. It defaults to dry-run; use `npm run clean-db:apply` after backup to apply.

7) Testing
   - After applying backfills/migrations, run the backend and frontend locally and exercise: create pet, public booking via the public page, and admin booking via the dashboard (if applicable).

If you want, I can:
- Create a Prisma migration file to alter the DB to set DEFAULT now() on Pet.updatedAt (requires prisma migrate workflow).
- Update admin appointment creation UI to prefer slotId as well (if you want full consistency).
